SikuliScripts
=============

Just some casual scripts.

HelloSikuli is just HelloWorld using Sikuli. Opens the start button on Windows.  
Assumes you're using Winsows.

SikuliImageConversion batch converts images into .png files.  
Assuming the file opens with GIMP.
See ConvertImage.java for all the preconditions. There's a lot.

Will document this properly later.
Spring break is over and I've got to pack up and leave in three hours.
I'll probably forget.
