# SikuliScripts
Just some practice with Sikuli. More information on Sikuli can be found here: http://www.sikuli.org/  

### HelloSikuli
HelloSikuli is code from the tutorial http://www.paulfrymire.com/2011/08/30/. This script is basically Hello World using Sikuli. This script clicks the start button on Windows 7, assuming the machine is currently using Windows 7.

### SikuliImageConversion
SikuliImageConversion converts a batch of images into .png files.  
This actually can be done in command line with GIMP using Scheme.

### Possible Future Work
- [ ] It's possible to batch convert images in command line with GIMP using Scheme.   
Try doing this, when gimp.org is no longer down.
